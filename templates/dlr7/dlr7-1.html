                    Energy is conserved in an electric circuit. Since power is simply energy per unit time, power is also conserved in an
                    electric circuit. You mentioned the notion of energy (power) conservation in your response and so let's review how it
                    applies to the circuit we are considering.

                    Applied to an electric circuit, the principle of conservation of energy states that energy is neither created nor
                    destroyed in an electric circuit and is only transformed. For example, in our circuit the voltage source provides energy
                    to the circuit and the resistors dissipate the energy thus heating up in the process. Perhaps the voltage source models
                    a battery with stored chemical energy that is transformed to electrical energy. In analyzing electric circuits, we are
                    typically not concerned with details such as chemical-to-electrical energy conversion and rather only seek to verify
                    that the sum of energy (i.e. power) dissipated or stored is precisely balanced by the amount of energy provided.
