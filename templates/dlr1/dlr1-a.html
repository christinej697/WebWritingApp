                <p>When beginning to study circuit analysis, it is not uncommon to have a very “localized” conception on how an electric
                circuit works. In such outlook, one is inclined to think that if a change is made somewhere in the circuit, only the
                element that is changed is impacted. Let's spend a couple of minutes making certain we look at a circuit as a system
                and not simply a connection of independent elements. Here is the circuit again in which we are to address what
                happens to the power in all four elements when the resistance of R2 decreases.</p>

                <p> Someone displaying localized reasoning in analyzing the above circuit might say that “as the value of R<sub>2</sub> decreases
                    only the power of R<sub>2</sub> will be affected.” We can quickly argue against such reasoning by considering what is meant by
                    power conservation in an electric circuit.
