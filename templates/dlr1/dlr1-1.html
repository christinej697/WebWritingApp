                    When beginning to study circuit analysis, it is not uncommon to have a very “localized” conception on how an electric circuit works. In such an outlook, one is inclined to think that if a change is made somewhere in the circuit, only the element that is changed is impacted. Let's spend a couple of minutes making certain we look at a circuit as a system and not simply a connection of independent elements. Here is the circuit again in which we are to address what happens to the power in all four elements when the resistance of <em>R<sub>2</sub></em> decreases.

                    Someone displaying localized reasoning in analyzing the above circuit might say that <q>as the value of <em>R<sub>2</sub></em> decreases
                    only the power of <em>R<sub>2</sub></em> will be affected.</q> We can argue against such reasoning by considering what is meant by
                    power conservation in an electric circuit.
